## Introduction

Looking at package `nlme` which really is older than R,
I have recently tried to use "modern" R idioms, which did not exist at the
time when `nlme` was created.

Rather, it had about half a dozen `as.name("model.frame")`.
(TODO: look more detailed in older versions)

and it is known to be "better" use  `quote(stats::model.frame)`  because
that also works in some cases, e.g., when `stats` is not attached (to the
`search` path).

Question: Is `quote()` also more efficient than `as.name("")` ?

```{r}
require("microbenchmark")

stopifnot(identical( quote(fooBar), as.name("fooBar") ))

(mb1 <- microbenchmark(quote(fooBar), as.name("fooBar"), times=1000))
boxplot(mb1) # -> ylab = "log(time) [t]"  --- what is [t] ???
## I rather want
boxplot(mb1, ylab = "nano-seconds  [log-scale]", notch=TRUE)
```

Yes:  `quote()` is **way** faster !
