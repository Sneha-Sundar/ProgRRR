# R programming

* *Lecturer*: Martin Mächler, Seminar für Statistik, ETH Zürich
* *Duration*: 2 days
* *Date & Time*:
- 20.Oct.2016, 9:00--17:00  (2 coffee breaks, lunch break)
- 21.Oct.2016, 9:00--~16:30            ditto

* *Target audience*:

	Advanced R users.  Knowledge about basic R language data types such as
	lists or the `lapply()` function is assumed, and typically
	you have written your own R functions before.

	(For introductory R courses please revisit the course list.)

* *Course language*: English (German if applicable to all participants)

* *Course description*
R has become one of the most efficient and versatile tool sets for solving
problems (in data analysis, visualization, teaching, rapid prototyping etc)
because it has been a design principle "turn ideas into software, quickly
and faithfully" (John Chambers, author of S, the precursor of R).
This enables you to build your own reliable tools for your
tasks, using R as an extendible programming language. The course provides a
thorough understanding of the R language.

* Topics include
    - Data types and classes of the R (programming) language
    - Functions in R -- _"Everything that happens is a function call"_
    - Programming tools: run time analysis, debugging; handling errors, warnings.
    - Good programming styles and practices
    - Writing reproducible R code - writing R packages

* Further mostly optional topics
 to be touched or treated detailed, depending on the participants needs:
    -  Namespaces, environments etc: _"Where does R find stuff?"_
    -  Object oriented programming with S3 and S4
    -  R code parallelization
    -  Using compiled code (C, C++, Fortran)
